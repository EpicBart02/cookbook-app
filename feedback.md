# C#

## Overall
Groupwork was not great all the time. You started late, prioritised other things and did not organise until told to. Agreed, you are hard working when you do work, but the overall impression is that of a not very professional group.

## Code 
The code is okay, but also varies in quality (from very nice to `if` statements with just a semicolon). It also looks a lot like you have tried your way out to a structure, but never really settled on anything. Like your groupwork, it is quite disorganised.

## Presentation
Okay, but could also be improved on.

Group grade: D
